# TRAFFIC MANAGMENT SYSTEM WITH OVERRIDING EMERGENCY VEHICLE
# The provided code creates a traffic monitoring simulation using Python and OpenCV, a computer vision library. This simulation represents a scenario where there are four virtual traffic lanes, each captured by a separate camera or video file. The program tracks the traffic density in each lane by analyzing the video frames and generates random traffic values for each lane.

# The simulation operates in real-time, continuously displaying the traffic conditions for all four lanes in a single window. It highlights the currently active lane with a filled circle and displays the corresponding traffic density as text on the video frame. The program automatically switches the active lane at regular intervals based on the timer value and the traffic density.

# The purpose of this simulation is to provide a visual representation of traffic changes in multiple lanes. It can be used for educational or demonstrational purposes to showcase how traffic monitoring systems work. Additionally, it allows users to observe how traffic density fluctuates across different lanes over time. By simulating lane switching, the program showcases how intelligent traffic management systems can adapt to changing conditions and allocate resources efficiently. Keeping in mind that this simulation is a simplified representation and not an actual traffic monitoring system used in real-world applications. Nonetheless, it serves as a valuable tool to understand and visualize traffic monitoring concepts in a straightforward and interactive manner.
