# TRAFFIC MANAGMENT SYSTEM WITH OVERRIDING EMERGENCY VEHICLE
# The code uses Python, OpenCV, and YOLO (You Only Look Once) to create a traffic monitoring simulation. It detects vehicles using YOLO in real-time and calculates traffic density for each of the four lanes. The simulation displays traffic conditions, with the active lane highlighted and its density shown as text. It demonstrates how intelligent traffic systems can efficiently manage traffic flow.
